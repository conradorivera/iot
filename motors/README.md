# Motor Stepper
This section is interesting to test different ways of play around with Stepper Motor.
It's cool because you can set the amount of movements (steps) you want to do.

## With Remote example
Has configured a way to interact with the Remote Control. The example comes with VOL+ and VOL- only but it can be extended.
### Future work
* Extend `Case` to accepts other entries.

## With encoder example
Has configured another Input module to interact with: the Rotary Encoder Module. Which has 3 possible movements: to the right, to the left and click. 

I found it great to do manual intervention because you can simulate exactly what the Motor does.

## Future work
* Connect the stepper with ESP* API
